\description{
Dataset containing various statistics for lumber products.
All units are in Billion Board Ft unless otherwise specified.
Year 1987 includes small volumes of mixed species (not classified as softwoods or hardwoods).
Data may not add to totals because of rounding. Estimates of softwood lumber production for certain years in the
late 1970's and early 1980's by the Bureau of the Census and some major softwood industry associations currently vary by as much as
5 percent. Cooperative studies are underway to resolve these differences. Revisions made by Census as a result of these studies
will be reported in future issues of U.S. timber production, trade, consumption, and price statistics.
