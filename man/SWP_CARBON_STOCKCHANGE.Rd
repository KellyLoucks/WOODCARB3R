\name{SWP_CARBON_STOCKCHANGE}
\alias{SWP_CARBON_STOCKCHANGE}
\title{Calculates changes in carbon stock from solid wood products.
Units are in Tg Carbon.
For production approach, values correspond to `Calculation$BY` in the spreadsheet.
For stock change approach, values correspond to `Calculation$H` in the spreadsheet.}
\usage{
SWP_CARBON_STOCKCHANGE(years, approach = c("Production", "Stock Change"),
  decaydistribution = c("Exponential", "K=2"), halflives = halfLives)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{years to return carbon totals for}

\item{approach}{The approach used to calculate carbon contribution.}

\item{decaydistribution}{Type of decay method to use}

\item{halflives}{data frame of half lives to use}
}
\value{
A vector of swp carbon stock changes for `years`
}
