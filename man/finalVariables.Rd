\title{Values for final 7 variables.
All units are in Gg Carbon
Var1A = Annual Change in stock of HWP in use form consumption
Var1B = Annual Change in stock of HWP in SWDS from consumption
Var2A = Annual Change in stock of HWP in use produced from domestic harvest
Var2B = Annual Change in stock of HWP in SWDS produced from domestic harvest
Var3 = Annual Imports of wood, paper products, wood fuel, pulp, recovered paper, roundwood/chips
Var4 = Annual Exports of wood, paper products, wood fuel, pulp, recovered paper, roundwood/chips
Var5 = Annual Domestic Harvest
Var6 = Annual release of carbon to the atmosphere from HWP consumption (from fuelwood & products
in use and products in SWDS)
Var 7 = Annual release of carbon to the atmosphere from HWP (including fuelwood) where wood came from
domestic harvest (from products in use and products in SWDS)}

\arguments{
\item{Years}{years to calculate}

\item{Variable}{variable to return}

\item{decaydistribution}{decay distribution to use (if necessary)}

\item{halflives}{half-lives for calculation (if necessary)}
