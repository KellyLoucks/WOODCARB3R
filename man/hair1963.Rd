Columns may not add to total because of rounding.
\item \strong{SawLogs.Dom.Prod} Domestic Production of Saw Logs
\item \strong{SawLogs.NetImports} Net Imports of Saw Logs.
Net imports of lumber converted to cubic feet roundwood.  Small quantities of imported saw logs (roundwood form) are included under domestic production.
\item \strong{SawLogs.ApparentConsumption} Apparent Consumption of Saw Logs.
Columns may not add to total because of rounding.
Includes changes in stocks beginning in 1935.
\item \strong{VeneerLogs.Dom.Prod} Domestic Production of Veneer Logs
\item \strong{VeneerLogs.NetImports} Net Imports of Veneer Logs.
Net imports of veneer logs represent the equivalent net imports of veneer and plywood converted to board feet log scale, and then to cubic feet round-wood.
The small volume of veneer logs imported (roundwood form) is included under domestic production.
\item \strong{VeneerLogs.ApparentConsumption} Apparent Consumption of Veneer Logs.
Columns may not add to total because of rounding.
\item \strong{PulpWood.Dom.Prod} Domestic Production of Pulpwood
\item \strong{PulpWood.NetImports} Net Imports of Pulpwood
\item \strong{PulpWood.ApparentConsumption} Apparent Consumption of Pulpwood
\item \strong{Other.ApparentConsumption} Apparent Consumption of Other Products
\item \strong{FuelWood.ApparentConsumption} Apparent Consumption of Fuelwood

\description{
Dataset containing estimated statistics for timber products. All vectors are numeric.
Most data is for products in the Industrial Roundwood Class. Each column except the first two and the last one
are in this category.
